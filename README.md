# Everipedia-EOS

This repo houses the EOS smart contracts which run the Everipedia Network on the EOS network. See the technical whitepaper documentation for conceptual functions, categorization, modularization, and theory.

To install and test, EOS Dawn 3.0+ is required. Simply download contract code, compile, and deploy to an EOS environment. 

NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS. THIS NOTICE WILL BE REMOVED WHEN A FINAL VERSION IS RELEASED.


## Brainpower
Voting on article edit proposals will be conducted though the use of brainpower, which is generated by staking IQ tokens for a period of 21 days. Sending 1 IQ to the article contract generates 1 brainpower, and there is no cap on the amount of total brainpower. Voting up or down article edit proposals consumes/burns brainpower.

The act of sending 1 IQ to the article contract is tracked by the stakes table. After 21 days, the IQ can be claimed back from the article contract, or left there to accumulate more brainpower in perpetuity. 

### Functions
For staking IQ to generate brainpower, use the `brainme` function.
For transferring brainpower, use the `brainyou` function.
For claiming IQ back after the staking period, use the `brainclaim` function.
